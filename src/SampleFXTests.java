/**
 * This class demonstrates how you can write junit tests for JavaFX GUIs.  It
 * uses the TestFX library's FxRobot class to simluate inputs from a user while
 * your test runs.  Documentation for the TestFX library can be found here:
 * https://testfx.github.io/TestFX/docs/javadoc/testfx-core/javadoc/org.testfx/module-summary.html
 * This jar files for this library have been packaged into a junit5fx.jar file
 * that can be downloaded using the instructions below, and can be used in place
 * of our old junit5.jar file going forward.
 *
 * To create your own tests like this:
 * 1) define your test class to extend ApplicationTest.
 * 2) copy-paste the @BeforeEach public void setup... method defined below into
 *    your own test class, and change the SampleApp reference inside to the be
 *    the name of your own class that extends javafx.application.Application.
 * 3) set the ids for any controls that you'd like your tests to be able to
 *    access: either to interact with or to check the updated state within.
 * 4) use the FxRobot API to simulate interaction with your GUI in your tests:
 *    https://testfx.github.io/TestFX/docs/javadoc/testfx-core/javadoc/org.testfx/org/testfx/api/FxRobot.html
 *
 * You can find examples of #3 in the SampleApp class below, and examples of #4
 * in the sample test methods that follow below.
 *
 * To compile and run the sample tests below:
 * 0) If you don't already have a javafx folder with the appropriate version
 *    of javafx right outside of your assignment folder, follow the instructions
 *    in A07 to download/create that folder.
 * 1) Download and use junit5fx.jar instead of our old junit5.jar file by
 *    running the following command inside your assignment folder:
 *    wget -P .. https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~cs400/junit5fx.jar
 * 2) To compile this file, you'll need both include the javafx modules, and
 *    include this new junit5fx.jar file in your classpath, as follows:
 *    javac --module-path ../javafx/lib --add-modules javafx.controls -cp .:../junit5fx.jar SampleFXTests.java
 * 3) Similar arguments are sent to java to run this sample application:
 *    java --module-path ../javafx/lib --add-modules javafx.controls -cp .:../junit5fx.jar SampleFXTests
 * 4) You'll also need these arguments to run the test runner, along with one
 *    additional argument (add-opens) to help our tests access javafx details:
 *    java --module-path ../javafx/lib --add-modules javafx.controls --add-opens javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.application=ALL-UNNAMED -jar ../junit5fx.jar -cp . -c SampleFXTests
 * 5) Sit back and watch the robot complete each of your tests.
 * You can update the above commands to work with your own tests by replacing
 * references to SampleFXTests with the name of your own test class.
